== Default admin user

First time you will need to create an administrator user called `dadmin`.
This user will be used to create extra users including custom administrators.

To create it, run with the following configurations properties:

- `defaults.admin.create`: set to `true`
- `defaults.admin.password`: set to the password you want to use.

Once created you can remove the properties. 
Also, for security reasons it is highly recommended to create custom administrators and remove the default afterwards.

WARNING: A new administrator user will ONLY be created when no other administrators exist.
